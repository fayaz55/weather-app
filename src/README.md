# React Weather App

This is a weather app I made using react. Simply type in a location in the search bar and hit enter. 
If the weather is above 15 degrees celsius a warm background will appear, otherwise a cold background will appear. 

Before using app, you must get an API key from https://openweathermap.org.
Place the API key in the key variable. 



In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
